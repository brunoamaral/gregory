# Sources and Articles

Some core concepts before we start, we use the term **Article** to refer to both science papers published in journals and news articles in other sources.

A **Source** is any website from where we can extract articles.

A **Subject** is a group of Sources and their respective articles. 

A **Category** is a group of articles whose title matches at least one keyword in a list for terms for the category. Categories can include articles across subjects.

## Sources



1. source id
1. name
1. link (link to the RSS feed)
1. language
1. subject (A source is usually a search page for a given subject, like Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, or other conditions)
1. method (how we fetch information, should be "rss")
1. source for (will be used for the "kind" field in articles, can be one of "science paper", "news", "trials")
1. ignore ssl (whether we should bypass SSL certificate verification or not)

You can add sources through the Django Backoffice found at `/admin/`, the example below shows how to add PubMed as an RSS source.

11. sent to admin (whether the article was sent in the admin digest or not)

## About Subjects and Categories

A **Subject** is a group of Sources and their respective articles. 

A **Category** is a group of articles whose title matches at least one keyword in list for that category. Categories can include articles across subjects.

There are API endpoints and RSS feeds to filter lists of articles by their category or subject in the format `articles/category/<category>` and `articles/subject/<subject>` where and is the lowercase name with spaces replaced by dashes.

### RSS feeds

1. Latest articles by subject, `https://DOMAIN.COM/feed/articles/subject/<subject>/`
2. Latest articles by category, `https://DOMAIN.COM/feed/articles/category/<category>/`

### API endpoints

1. Latest articles by subject, `https://DOMAIN.COM/articles/subject/<subject>/`
2. Latest articles by category, `https://DOMAIN.COM/articles/category/<category>/`
